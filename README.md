# Final Project
#### by Alex McClead

## Overview:
For this project we where given data on Bank Telemarketing. The data can be fround in data/Bank-Telemarketing.csv
After Review we where supposed to 

    1. Process the data
    2. Create a predictive model and store it in ML Tracking system
    3. Download Best Performing model and Deploy model as API
    4. Containerize model and API
    5. Output container to Cloud repository
    6. Deploy Containerized model and API in Kubernetes Cluster
    
    
## Summary:

After preprocessing the data and testing multiple models I am able to create and deploy a model with 90% accuracy using a Random Forest model. I am also able to containerize and deploy the container the cloud container registry. See bellow an image of the saved models:

and you can see here the file outputed to the cloud registry:

This is a demo of the api in use, run from a container:
